	<blockquote><p><h3>Legend of the Zhong</h3>Ernest Hemingway was once egged on at a bar to write a six-word story on a napkin. His friends said he couldn’t do it, and then offered him a bet. Hemingway grabbed a napkin and wrote: “For sale, Baby shoes, never worn...” This legend, over the years, transformed into a new style of writing and hence the zhong was born.</p><cite>http://livejournal.com</cite>
	<p>Zhong is a Chinese-derived word with several meanings depending on context. It means “middle,” “centered,” “bullseye,” “hit the mark.” (pronounced “jhoong”)
	Zhong can help writers better convey their thoughts more clearly and concisely.</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Read all that you can and do it everyday.</li>
	  <li>Find a special place you feel comfortable to write or that inspires you because of the ambience, colors, smells, etc. Morning is a great time to do your writing especially with a cup of coffee or any favorite morning beverage.</li>
	  <li>Make a daily assessment in a written journal format where you can jot down observances, ideas as they come to mind, especially lines from anything you run across or think of that you may want to use in writing later or now; Write or draw anything that you feel would be useful or inspires you on an idea for a work of writing. These can include goals, inspiration reminders, dreams you remember, reminders from the past, photos that made you think of certain descriptions or story lines, etc.</li>
	  <li>Make an entry about today’s weather and how it is affecting you emotionally and mentally. Is it beneficial to your state of creativity and inspiration. How would you describe it literally and/or metaphorically. This could be your first writing assignment of the day.</li>
	  <li> Jot down ideas about genres that fit in with your values, tastes, goals in writing endeavors, mood, etc. Do some research on the genre type to find out about specifics and components of that genre or subgenre. Perhaps a particular genre fits your fancy for today, the next few weeks, months, years, ...Highlight areas in your research that you want to focus in on about that medium of writing over the course of however long you spend on your next work. I’m sure they are bound to be some ideas in there for you, even in research, ideas for stories abound.</li>
	  <li> Think about characters. Jot down any ideas about a character or characters. What types of persons do they represent? Think about what you would like your protagonist, antagonist, and secondary or tertiary characters to look like, act like, think like, be motivated by, desire, be wiling to do anything for something, personalities, conversations and conversational jargons or way of speech that differentiates them from others; thin about their names; how you want other characters to portray them in the storyline. Secondary characters and even sometimes tertiary or extra side characters aid your main character in meeting his ultimate goal perhaps and often aid in resolving complications along the way. What do the characters’ do? What do you as the author have to say about them to yourself or will you invoke your views in your writing?</li>
	  <li>If stuck, take a break. Take a walk. Go shopping for some supplies for your writing: a white board and dry erase markers, a beautiful journal to keep ideas in, pens or a pen you’d really enjoy writing with, pick up some books you’ve been wanting to read and delve in for a while, and so on.</li>
